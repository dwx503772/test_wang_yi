Cover four areas in your life: your early years, education, work experience, and your current situation. Keep your complete answer to about 2 minutes; don't ramble or elaborate. This is your 2-minute self-introduction and you will be very accomplished at giving it by the time you are in job interviews. Because this question usually comes early in the interview, you will gain confidence by knowing you can answer it well.

51TestingÈí¼ş²âÊÔÍø4Pt#n8aQ o;Z%jLo
If this question is asked early in the interview, you might respond by discussing generally how your skills and experience would benefit the company. To get more specific, you will need to know something about the job situation they have in mind and that subject is not usually discussed until the end of the interview. Resist the temptation to frame an answer based on your assumptions about the position. If the question is asked after the interviewer has described the position, only then can you relate any of your accomplishments to the problems of your prospective employer. This is an opportune time to discuss your problem-solving abilities.51TestingÈí¼ş²âÊÔÍø!dfCm0W{FbU

"E sdsxo@2UJs051TestingÈí¼ş²âÊÔÍøL\2d9Z.\h$_
The timing of this question is critical, since you can't give any specific answer without knowing some details about the position, organization and culture. Even if you do, be careful about describing sweeping changes you might want to make. Unless the interviewer has specified critical problem areas that you feel comfortable addressing, limit your answer to explaining the need to study the current organization, talk with staff, and fully assess the implications before recommending any changes.51TestingÈí¼ş²âÊÔÍø e#ZC W5[c r2Q

This is a very important question, so you will want to take the time to answer it in logical steps. When talking about your relationships with subordinates, be prepared to state your management philosophy, particularly with regard to performance issues. When speaking of bosses, indicate your keen interest in understanding your boss's expectations, so that you and your organization can build your goals in a way that will support his/her goals. You may also want to talk about how you would keep your boss informed. Stress your team-building, mutually cooperative approach with peers.51TestingÈí¼ş²âÊÔÍø8YNze[k

Remember that your hobbies and recreation activities can be quite revealing as to your own personality and values.
